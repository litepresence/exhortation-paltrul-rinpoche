This the first English translation of Paltrul Rinpoche's Exhortation to read Longehenpa's 7 Treasuries.  

It was produced by Qwen 3 Max in about 80 hours by 10 iterations of providing "conventions.md" and the latest draft in chunks to couplets of alternating chat sessions with prompts:

## Session 1

### USER
"review my draft in light of the conventions"

<conventions>
<chunk1>
<chunk2>
<chunk3>  
etc.

## Session 2

### USER
"improve my draft in light of the critical review and the conventions"

<conventions + review>
<chunk1>
<chunk2>
<chunk3>  
etc.
